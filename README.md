# ai-technology-programs-brazil
Reproducible data analysis of the historical emergence of Artificial Intelligence programs in Brazilian higher education technology courses (1995–2025), based on INEP Higher Education Census microdata.

# AI Technology Programs Brazil

This repository contains a fully reproducible research pipeline designed to investigate the historical emergence and expansion of higher education technology programs explicitly denominated "Artificial Intelligence" in Brazil.

The analysis is based on official microdata from the Brazilian Higher Education Census (INEP), covering the complete historical series (1995–latest available year).

## Project Overview

This project investigates the emergence and expansion of higher education technology programs explicitly denominated "Artificial Intelligence" in Brazil.

Using official microdata from the Brazilian Higher Education Census (INEP), the study reconstructs the historical trajectory (1995–latest available year) of undergraduate and graduate programs whose official titles contain the expression “Inteligência Artificial”.

The research aims to provide empirical evidence for the emergence of Artificial Intelligence as a new educational field within Brazilian higher education.

## Research Objectives

- Identify the first officially registered higher education program with the denomination “Inteligência Artificial”.
- Construct a complete historical timeline of program expansion.
- Separate undergraduate and graduate offerings.
- Analyze institutional distribution (public/private, modality, region).
- Generate reproducible statistical outputs and visualizations.
- Provide empirical evidence supporting the emergence of a new educational field.
